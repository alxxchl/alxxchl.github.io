          <h2 class="strip-heading">Asakusa</h2>
          <p class="strip-text">
            Asakusa is one of the last areas of Tokyo that preserves an Edo-era atmosphere, centered around its historic temple, Senso-ji, and busy shitamachi side streets. Before visiting the temple, be sure to catch the panoramic view from the rooftop of the Kengo Kuma-designed Asakusa Tourist Office and then stop by Azuma Bridge over the Sumida River for the classic photo opportunity of Tokyo Skytree and Philippe Starck's distinctive Asahi Beer Tower. From the bridge, you can also take river cruises, notably to Hamarikyu Garden’s Tea House. To reach Senso-ji, walk through Kaminarimon Gate and stroll along Nakamise Street, a bustling area full of souvenir shops, gorgeous kimono stores, and local snacks. While Nakamise is tempting, ensure you explore Denbo-in Street and Nishi-Sando Street, located to the west of the main path, which includes unique spots like the vintage kimono store Kocho. For culinary delights, make sure to try Age-Manju (deep-fried mochi) at Kokone on Nakamise Street and Taiyaki (fish-shaped waffles) at Kurikoan. For a refreshing break, Yifang offers Taiwanese fresh-fruit and tapioca tea, while green tea enthusiasts should visit Suzukien, north of Senso-ji, which is famous for its seven levels of matcha ice cream, including the reportedly world's strongest No. 7.

          <h2 class="strip-heading">Shinjuku</h2>
          <p class="strip-text">
            Shinjuku is a popular Tokyo hub known for its intense, neon-lit "Blade Runner" atmosphere, vibrant nightlife, and sprawling area around the world's busiest train station. The best way to experience the vast city view is from the free Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building Observatories on the West Side, where you might even see Mount Fuji on a clear day. The East Side hosts Kabukicho, a district famous for its gritty, brightly lit streets, adult entertainment venues, and host/hostess clubs, watched over by a giant Godzilla statue. While daytime shopping is available in the Shinjuku Sanchome area, the East Side truly comes alive with LED light displays at night. Before heading out, visitors can relax at the beautiful Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, or visit Sekaido for art supplies. For food, the area offers the undisputedly best vegan fluffy pancakes at Ain Soph., and authentic nighttime culture can be found in the gritty yokocho backstreet alleys; while Golden Gai and Omoide Yokocho are famous, the less-touristy Omoide Nukemichi offers a great experience. Finally, the West Side is home to Yodobashi Camera's Shinjuku West store, an iconic spot known both for being a massive electronics retailer and for its famous neon light displays.

Another great, free viewing spot is the Kiriko Terrace rooftop garden and pool atop Tokyu Plaza.
