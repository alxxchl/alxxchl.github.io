          <p class="strip-text">
            Dotonbori is the dazzling entertainment and gastronomic heart of Osaka, famous for its illuminated signboards, particularly the iconic Glico Running Man. It is worth visiting because it embodies Osaka's nickname, "Kuidaore" (eat until you drop), with countless restaurants and street food stalls offering local specialties like takoyaki (octopus balls) and okonomiyaki (savory pancakes). You can go to take photos of the massive, mechanized crab, fish, and dumpling signs, sample regional cuisine, and enjoy the lively, canal-side atmosphere, especially after sunset.
