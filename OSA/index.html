          <p class="strip-text">
            Lujiazui is the glittering, futuristic financial district of Shanghai, dramatically situated on a peninsula on the east bank of the Huangpu River, directly across from the historic Bund. This area is a striking symbol of China's economic ascent and modern urban ambition, defined by a cluster of supertalls that dominate the city's skyline. It is worth visiting to witness this architectural marvel and its sheer scale. You can ascend to the observation decks of towers like the Oriental Pearl TV Tower, the Shanghai World Financial Center, or the Shanghai Tower (one of the world's tallest buildings) for unparalleled, sweeping panoramic views across the city, providing a direct visual contrast with the historical buildings on the opposite side of the river.

Located on the west bank of the Huangpu River, the Bund is famed for its "architecture museum of the world," a stunning collection of over fifty early 20th-century European-style buildings—including former banks, trading houses, and consulates—that once defined the city's status as a global financial hub. Visitors stroll along the wide promenade to admire these grand structures, such as the Peace Hotel, while facing the breathtaking, futuristic skyline of Lujiazui in Pudong, making it the essential spot for experiencing Shanghai's unique, dual identity.
